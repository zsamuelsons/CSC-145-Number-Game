# CSC-145-Number-Game
This is a Game that a friend and I did during our first Computer Science course
The computer will choose a number.
Then, you choose a number.
If it's too high or low, the computer will let you know, until you guess the correct number!
Once you do guess the correct number, the program will tell you how many tries it took
Then, the game will ask if you would like to play again!
